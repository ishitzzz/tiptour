Gemini and JEV use the same action engine. Keep provider networking in their respective directories, execution in the action/workflow layer, and app-specific quirks in markdown skills. Neither UI nor providers should bypass the engine's action permissions or pauses.

The app has no screen recording, image-generation, hosted-key proxy, Claude planner, or Hermes integration. Tutorial videos the user chooses are sent to Elorian only to build tours. General documentation stays outside the bundled `TipTour` directory.
